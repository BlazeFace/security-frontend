        <h1 class="font-bold p-2 text-center">Our Digital Security Planner Project</h1>
        <div class="text-left p-1">
          <p class="py-2">Utilizing our wide range of academic specialties, we as a class have worked together to create a digital security planner that Virginia Tech students could use to strengthen their personal and digital security. Our planner consists of a variety of topics that may be of your interest, and if you are unsure of what areas you wish to secure further, there is a quiz provided on a separate tab that will prompt you answer a variety of questions that will help filter out the topics so that a selected handful are chosen for you based on your options.</p>

        <h1 class="font-bold p-2 text-center">Future of the Planner</h1>
        <div class="text-left p-1">
          <p class="py-2">Although we have only created a beta version of the planner this semester, we hope that the next steps to advancing the planner will be to create a more appealing website with a fully interactive quiz and an increased list of security suggestion topics.</p>
